## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I build tools, processes, applications, etc to help business grow. I work primarily in Ruby, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Python. 

Currently:
- Engineer at Vaspian. We provide communications tools to businesses. Our tech suite is great and our customer support is even better.
- I build the systems our team uses to run the business. This includes custom apps and leveraging the Zoho Suite of software. These contributions have contributed to a 10x increase in revenue for a particular product as well as automated billing for all services.
- Current problem how to generate more leads

A little more about me:
-
- Married to beautiful wife and 3 wonderful kids
- Love to garden
