## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I build tools, processes, applications, etc to help business grow. I work primarily in Ruby, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Python. 

Currently:
- Consultant at Zenatta Consulting. We configure SaaS products for customers and do custom software development
- I design the systems our clients use, interface with our development team, do a portion of the development myself, and Q/A the work.

A little more about me:
-
- Married to beautiful wife and 3 wonderful kids
- Love to garden
